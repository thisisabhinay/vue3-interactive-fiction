      The world is a blur. Colors swirl and drip like melting wax over your vision. You try to speak
      but only a croaking whisper escapes. A prickling tingle fills your limbs. Are you asleep?
      Awake? Somewhere in between?
    </p>
    <p>A disembodied voice, smooth yet tinged with an unsettling distortion, echoes around you.</p>

    <SpeechText>
      Welcome, wanderer. You are in the Dream Tapestry, a realm spun from the threads of the
      subconscious. Reality here isâ€¦ malleable. Your will is your tool and your mind, the clay.
