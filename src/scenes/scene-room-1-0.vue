    <p class="first-letter:text-4xl first-letter:font-bold">
      <span :class="interactionSpanClass" @click="interactWithTheWorld"> The world is a blur.</span>
      Colors swirl and drip like melting wax over your vision. You try to speak but only a croaking
      whisper escapes. A prickling tingle fills your limbs. Are you asleep? Awake? Somewhere in
      between?
    </p>
    <InteractionDescription v-if="theWorld[gameAction.LOOK_AT]" text="Look at: The Blurred World">
      <SceneDescription>
        Focusing on the blurring world sends spirals of color twisting at the edges of your vision,
        causing a faint sense of vertigo. The shapes seem to coalesce momentarily, hinting at
        impossible landscapes and distorted figures.

    <InteractionDescription v-if="theWorld[gameAction.TOUCH]" text="Touch: The Blurred World">
      <SceneDescription>
        Reaching out feels disorienting. Your hand seems to pass through shifting mists and swirling
        hues. A cold tingle lingers on your fingers.
      </SceneDescription>
    </InteractionDescription>

    <p>A disembodied voice, smooth yet tinged with an unsettling distortion, echoes around you.</p>

    <SpeechText>
      Welcome, wanderer. You are in the Dream Tapestry, a realm spun from the threads of the
      subconscious. Reality here isâ€¦ malleable. Your will is your tool and your mind, the clay.
