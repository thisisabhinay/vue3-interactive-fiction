  <SceneDescription>
    As you will yourself to motion, there is no feeling of a solid floor. Instead, your sense of
    self stretches and twists. With a nauseating lurch, the landscape changes. You now find yourself
    standing in a forest where the trees have eyes instead of leaves and the ground writhes with a
    carpet of iridescent worms.
